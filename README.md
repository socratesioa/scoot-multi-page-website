- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Vite
- Sass/SCSS

### What I learned

This was my first full project using React so needless to say I learned a ton. Using components, passing data, some JSX syntax. The basics of React. It was a great experience and I am very proud of it.

### Continued development

I just started learning and working with React so there's a lot to learn and play around with.
